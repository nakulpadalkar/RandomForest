# Random Forest Teaching Demonstration

Welcome to the Random Forest Teaching Demonstration repository! This repository contains the resources and code examples for the demonstration conducted using Visual Studio Code and Live Share.

## Description

This teaching demonstration aims to provide an interactive session on random forest, a popular machine learning algorithm. Participants will learn about the theory and implementation of random forest while actively collaborating through Visual Studio Code and Live Share.

## Prerequisites

To participate in this teaching demonstration, you'll need the following:

- Stable internet connection
- Web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge)
- Live Share link (provided by the instructor)
- Optional: GitHub account (for collaborative code sharing)

Before the demonstration, please ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or above)
- Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- Visual Studio Code (download from https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Visual Studio Code extensions: Live Share, Remote - SSH (optional)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-forest-demo.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

```python
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```


3. If you wish to connect to a remote server for development (using SSH), install the "Remote - SSH" extension in Visual Studio Code.

4. Launch Visual Studio Code and open the cloned repository.

5. Join the Live Share session using the provided Live Share link.

6. Follow the instructor's guidance throughout the demonstration to learn about random forests and participate actively.

## Resources

- `code/`: Contains code examples and Jupyter notebooks used during the teaching demonstration.
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets for hands-on exercises. In this case, we will use Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- `references/`: Includes reference materials and links related to the random forest. Most of the presentation is built on Microsoft Technical Report.
